    <h1>Born a crime</h1>
    <h2>Book review</h2>

<p>Born a crime is one interesting,compelling,sad and funny story by Treavor Noah.
    Treavor Noah who is the author,tells us his story while growing up.
    While growing up Treavor was a mischeavous boy,who struggled to find 
    himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist.
    In the book,Treavor also potrays some characters of the mom which I admire greatly,
    She was a hero.
    One of the things I admired on Treavor's  mom was her free spirit,her fearlessness,rebellious,independence and religious traits.
    <img id="momtreva" src="Pictures/Treavor and the mom.jpg"> 
    <p>Treavor's mom in the book is high spirited and makes her own decision without being compelled by anyone.
    He says<em>"Abel wanted a tradional marriage with a traditional wife.For a long time,I wondered why he ever married a woman like 
     my mom  in the first place,as she was the opposite of that in every way"</em>
    Treavor's mom was not the submissive type who depended on the husband for provision but rather she was a hardworking lady who fended for herself.
    Despite Abel disagreeing with her on the issue of going to church,she still went ahead with her normal routine of going to church with public transport after Abel refused
    to repair her car.
    
    <p>Am not to the opinion that women should be caged by their spouses and do everything
    as instructed to them without their concent.I believe that the society should stop
    viewing women as weak beings that are controlled anytime.For instance,Travor tells us
    that in Tzaneen,there were plenty of girls being raised solely to bow to men.In Tsonga culture,where Abel comes from,
    its patriarchal in such a way that women must bow when they greet a man.There was also  limited interactions between men and women.
    I believe that a man can be with a woman and still  be in her own making her decisions without being compelled to do so.     
    </p>
    <p>In my opinion I strongly believe thet there are some of the backward traditions that can be ruled out.For instance,
    In Tsonga culture,practice like bowing to men when greeting them while they do not do the same.I believe that respect is a 
    two way thing and and its not only the women to show respect to men while they are not  treated with the same respect.
    I liked the way Treavor's mom ridicule this  by over doing it.<em>"My mom would go down and cower,groveling in the dirt liked
    she was worshipping a deity,and she'd stay there for a long time,like really long time,long enough to make everyone very uncomfortable"</em></p>    
    <p>Women should be able to stand for themselves or fall for anything.When Patricia failed to stand up for herself Abel took advantage 
     of her by beating her and even after reporting Abel to the police,nothing serious was done and the issue was brushed off after
     Abel convinced the officers that it was the normal sturbboness of the women.This shows how women were belittled and there 
     words were not considered.
    </p>
    <p>To sum it up,I believe that women can be with a man and still be on her own especially when she makes her own money.
        If only all women should understand the importance of standing for themselves,some serious issues like being 
        henpecked in the society can stop.</p>
