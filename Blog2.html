    <h3>A  picture of Treavor Noah with his dog</h3>
    <div class="blogger2">
        <p>In born a crime Treavor Noah was this mischievous  boy  and also funny,his humour nature is seen in several instances
            throughout the book.One outstanding thing about the use of humour in this book is how Treavor Noah use it to save
            himself on several occasions when he was in trouble and how he used it to make friends,this is illustrated as follows.
            </p>
            <p>Treavor Noah get  out of trouble when he shit in the house and he fails to admit to his mistake
            rather he even helped the family in prayers for casting out demons knowing very well he was responsible for that.
            He says<em>"I was terrified.I believed in the power of prayer.I knew that my prayers worked.So if I prayed to God to kill
            the thing that left the shit,and the shit was me,then God was going to kill me"</em>Its very funny how he watched the
            mom and gran stood around the burning shit praying and singing and he watched them without any guilt.
            Who does that!</p>
            <p>Treavor Noah and his mom got out of trouble  after jumping out from a moving minibus after sensing
            danger  when the driver of the minibus was driving too fast and was not stopping even after he was asked
            to stop by Treavor's  mom.They decide to jump out of the minibus and they share a moment,by laughing and
            joking about the whole incidence at the petrol station.He says<em>"She broke down in a huge smile and started
            laughing.I started laughing,too,and we stood there,this little boy and his mom ,our arms and legs covered
             in blood and dirt,laughing together through the pain in the light of a petrol station on the side of
            the road in the middle of the night.   
            </em></p>
            <p>Treavor knew many languages and through this he saved himself from the young Zulu guys that wanted to
            attack him.He uses humour to demonstrate  how he tried talking the boys from attacking him and even suggested
            for them to attack someone else.He says<em>"Yo,guys,why don't we just mug someone together?I'm ready.Let's
            do it"</em>making the boys shocked and they started laughing apologizing to him telling him that
            they thought he was something else. 
            </p>
            <p>It's not usual for parents to call their children thieves especially when that is not the case,but Treavor's mom does that.
            When Treavor was growing old and her mom was no longer able to run after him and catch him,she decided to use a new trick,
            by running after Treavor in the streets and calling him a thief,humour is seen when Treavor also run trying to save himself
            from the mom,he was  running while trying to defend himself that he was not a thief but his mom's son.</p>
            <p>Another instance where Treavor used humour and saved him out of trouble is when he decided to drink the grape juice
             and crackers in school  meant for holy communion  for the catholic kids in school.One of the kid ratted him out during
             confession to the priest and it's funny how Treavor says that the priest had break the law after talking about what one of the
             the member had confessed during confessions which was against the the catholic rules.Trevor was not punished by the mom
             for what he did rather he asked the teacher why he was punishing a child for eating Jesus's body and Jesua's feet.
            </p>  
            <p>Treavor also use humour to gain and maintain friendship in his new school after leaving Maryvale school.In H.A jack primary
            he found students move and play in groups according to their colour and due to the fact that he was mixed,he did
            not  have any group that he could fit and hangout with.To make friends,he had to go to different groups where other kids from
            different races were playing to crack jokes to them,and he end up making friends with different kids at school who
            were looking forward to listening to his jokes.  </p>
